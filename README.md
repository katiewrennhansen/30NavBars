## 30 navbars in 30 days
___
The goal of this project is to develop my skills at creating responsive navbars from scratch.
This is always something that I have been fascinated with learning but have always struggled
to figure out. Each time I come to the point of building a navbar in a project, I can't seem
to get it right and I want to change that. In this 30 day project, I will design and build 
30 unique navbars to build my skills at creating mobile-first, responsive navbars.

### Day 1
Sept 8, 2019
I am starting with a simple - non collapsable nav bar just to get practice positioning the 
elements. I will use flexbox to place all of my components. This nav is designed for a simple
site with smaller navigation needs. It will be responsive for each screen size.

### Day 2
Sept 9, 2019
My second navbar is collapsed up until a display of 768px has been hit. This nav uses an 
animation on the toggle button to make an X while the collapsed nav is open. The collapsed
nav also takes up the entirity of the screen while it is open. When the screen size passes
768px, then the nav uses flexbox to stretch across the screen at all times.
